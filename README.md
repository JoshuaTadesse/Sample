This code snippet is from a project called OneStop based, built and deployed in Ethiopia. The project is a service provider and customer connection app. It is built on an Angular framework. Typescript is the language behind it. 
The snippet added is of a sub admin management component. I built this component alongside many others, and I feel it represents my skills well. It has a create, edit, remove and view option for all subadmins. It also allows to add permissions for each subadmin individually. 
You can find the full project at https://etonestop.com
